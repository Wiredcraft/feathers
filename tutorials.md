## Getting started


Here, we create a simple example based on **feather** what we built. 

This will show you how **feathers** can handle your MVC framework, every time you build an app, you need to spend too many time to figure the structure out and that was the point where we started from. 

[Backbone](http://backbonejs.org) provides can use those basic infrastructure, and [feathers](https://github.com/Wiredcraft/feathers/wiki/) provides real usable and handy structure. Now, we can start building application based on **feathers** without considering how to combine those basic infrastructure.

We separate model and collection 

* Models : 
* Collections : 
* Interaction with API :
